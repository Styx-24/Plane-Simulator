# Plane Simulator

## How to Install

Download [the installer](https://github.com/Styx-24/Plane-Simulator/releases/tag/first) and run it, a pop up window will most likely warn you that windows has protected your computer. Click more info and run anyway. If you are worried of getting infected, feel free to verify the code in the git.
You can now run the corsponding exe for the simulator or senario generator in the install directory.  
A senario is provided in the release to run the simulator without having to generate a senario first.
